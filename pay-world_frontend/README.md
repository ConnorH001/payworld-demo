Installation

# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/connorh001/payworld-demo.git
cd pay-world_api

# 2. Install both frontend & backend dependencies
npm install

Environment Variables


# Backend
Create a .env file in the project root with:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=payworld_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600s

Database Setup
Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally.

Create a database:

psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE payworld_db;"


Running the App (run this at the root of the project)

npm start



Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:8080/

`npm start` uses concurrently to launch both servers in one shot.


(side note: i have added docker ymls but couldnt get this running locally yet)





Usage

Open the frontend in your browser. (localhost:3000)

Register or log in (demo credentials allowed).

Create an organization account.

Add one or more Mock bank/payment accounts.

Click into an account to view/add/approve payments.

Watch your JWT expire after inactivity and re-login.

All interactions happen on the homepage via intuitive dialogs.

To log out simply click the button on the top right . 

Those not signed in are redirected to the login page
